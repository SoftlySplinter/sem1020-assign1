The three presenters should use this paper to develop a group presentation in
which every presenter gets to speak. The whole presentation should take about 45
minutes, with each presenter having about 15 minutes to speak.

Following the presentations, there will be about half an hour's discussion about
the paper that has been presented. This will include prepared questions from the
two questioners.
