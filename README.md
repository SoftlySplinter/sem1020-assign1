# SEM1020 - Assignment 1: Seminars

For each seminar a member of staff will assign papers that everyone will be
expected to read. One person will present each paper. Others will prepare
discussion questions. Your presentations and contribution are worth 15% of your
mark.

## February 28th - Abstract State Machines (presenter)

This week's document is available online:

The three presenters should use this paper to develop a group presentation in
which every presenter gets to speak. The whole presentation should take about 45
minutes, with each presenter having about 15 minutes to speak.

Following the presentations, there will be about half an hour's discussion about
the paper that has been presented. This will include prepared questions from the
two questioners.

## March 7th - Abstract State Machines

There are three papers this week, all available via Primo:

* Egon Boerger Abstract State Machines: a unifying view of models of computation and of system design frameworks Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 133, pp 149-171, Elsevier 2005
* Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich Persistent Queries in the Behavioral Theory of Algorithms ACM Transactions on Computational Logic, Vol 12, No 2, January 2011
* Egon Boerger, Antonio Cisternino, Vincenzo Gervasi Ambient Abstract State Machines with applications Journal of Computer and System Sciences 78, pp939-959, Elsevier 2012

The papers are fairly long and technically challenging. You will need to use the reading skills that we looked at on Feb 7th, in the session 'How to read a scientific paper'. This will mean focusing on the introduction and conclusions of the papers, and using judgement to decide on the level of detail that will benefit you as an individual and that will allow you to take an effective part in the discussions.

The three presentations should be given in the order of publication of the papers. Each presenter should speak for about 15 minutes, and there will be about 15 minutes for discussion. The discussions will include prepared questions from the four questioners.

Questioners, could you also please email your questions to [eds](mailto:eds@aber.ac.uk).

Everybody, be prepared to discuss the papers.
