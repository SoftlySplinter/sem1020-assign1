# Abstract State Machines - session 2


## Abstract State Machines: a unifying view of models of computation and of system design frameworks

Proof computation 

Define ASMs using:

* ASMs
* Control State ASMs (based on FSM)
* Turbo ASM
* Classical Computation

### ASMs

**if** *Condition* **then** *Updates*

* *Condition* is a closed predicate logic formula.
* *Updates* is a finite set of the form *f(t1,...,tn) := t* whose execution is understood to be changing.

* An ASM step in a given state executes all update simultaneously
* If the updates are consistent then the ASM procedes to the next state
* If not if doesn't
* Updates are consistent if it contains no pair of updates at the same location

* When dealing with multi-agent systems a set of agents executes its own ASM.
* In asynchronous multi-agent systems a "run" becomes a partially ordered set of single agents.

### Control State ASMs

Internal states managed by a FSM for synchronous parellism.

```
if ctl_state = i then
  if cond 1 then
    rule 1
    ctl_state = j 1
    
  ...
  
  if cond n then
    rule n
    ctl_state = j n
```

### Trubo ASMs

ASMs built from basic ASMs, rule calls, seqential and iteration submachines.


## Classical Computation

Using Turing machines, etc.
