# Abstract State Machines - session 2


## Abstract State Machines: a unifying view of models of computation and of system design frameworks

Proof computation 

Define ASMs using:

* ASMs
* Control State ASMs (based on FSM)
* Turbo ASM
* Turing Machines

### ASMs, Control State ASMs and Trubo ASMs

ASMs:

**if** *Condition* **then** *Updates*

* *Condition* is a closed predicate logic formula.
* *Updates* is a finite set of the form *f(t1,...,tn) := t* whose execution is understood to be changing.
