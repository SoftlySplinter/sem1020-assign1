# Abstract State Machines - Notes

* Development Methodology not dissimilar from normal Software Development.
* A way of document software - elegant and provable.
  * Simple but effective
  * Not tied to a language
* Appears to fit well with formal methods
* High-level description, which can be made lower level
  * Has some "magic" to help this.
* Kinds of data are types of data, but ASMs are not type-safe.
  * Sets or "universes".


## Example 1 - Greatest Common Divisor

Let's consider the problem of computing the greatest common divisor of two
positive integers. What universes would we need?

* Positive integers `PosInt`.
  * Yes this can be infinite even though computers can only handle finite
    numbers.

Define a function:

`gcd(PosInt, PosInt) -> PosInt`

Very high level of abstraction. Lower level abstraction would then need a modulo
function, but this requires a new set as it can return 0 (which isn't a positive
integer).

* `Nat` such that `PosInt âŠ† Nat` and `Nat - Posint = {0}`



`mod(PosInt, PosInt) -> Nat`

## Verification of ASMs

Several techniques for verifying ASMs:

1. Code Reviews
2. Testing
3. Formal Proofs

### Code Reviews

Review the ASM as its built and its final design.

Has the advantage that it's not written in a programming language, so domain
experts don't have to be expert programmers.


### Testing

Because ASMs can be made executable using external tools such as AsmL and XASM,
it can therefore be run to test the ASM.

Can be tested at any point of the development process.


### Formal Methods

ASMs provide some of the tools and terminology that are needed to make a formal
proof.

Use depends on the ASM, but it can be used to gain a precise and understandable
ground model. Others are for a full formal description to prove correctness.

## Final Thoughts

ASMs are easier to learn through examples.

Can be used for real-time systems (multi-agent ASMs).
